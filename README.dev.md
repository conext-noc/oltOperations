# DEVELOPING:

### VENV

- Use of virtualenvs:
  Virtual environments in Python are a best practice that allows you to create isolated environments to work on specific Python projects. Here are some reasons why you should use virtual environments in Python:

  1. Isolation: Virtual environments allow you to create a completely isolated environment for each project you are working on. This means that any packages you install or dependencies you add will only be installed in that specific environment and not affect your global Python installation.
  2. Reproducibility: By creating a virtual environment for each project, you can ensure that your project's dependencies are consistent and reproducible. This makes it easier for others to replicate your project and for you to work on it in the future.
  3. Dependency management: Managing dependencies can be a challenging task, especially when working on multiple projects simultaneously. Virtual environments help to simplify this process by allowing you to easily install and manage dependencies for each project.
  4. Version control: Virtual environments make it easier to use version control tools like Git. By including your virtual environment in your project's repository, you can ensure that anyone who clones your repository can easily set up the same environment as you.

  Overall, virtual environments in Python help to create a more organized, reproducible, and efficient workflow.

> In case that virtualenv is not installed by pip
```terminal
[bash]$ pip install virtualenv
```
> adding a virtual env
```terminal
[bash]$ python -m virtualenv <virtual enviroment folder name>
```

### CLONING AND SETUP

For clonning this project issue the command:
```terminal
[bash]$ git clone https://github.com/conext-noc/oltOperations.git
```
OR if you have the ssh key and set up ssh with github with your account.
```terminal
[bash]$ git clone git@github.com:conext-noc/oltOperations.git
```

then download the [.env, service_account_olt_operations.json] files from the conext noc drive folder located in the IT>SCRIPTS folder or simply ask for them if you work at the tech department.

once those files are downloaded and put in this directory set up the virtual env.

once the virtual env is placed use the following command:
```terminal
[bash]$ source ./`<venv folder name>`/bin/activate
```
then install all deps:
```terminal
[bash]$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then all is set for usage or development.

### HOW TO DEVELOP

#### MODULE

for developing a module rename the module in a 2 letter word nomenclature, if the module is used in various places try to rename it into a genreal way to improve DRY code

the fuction of the module should be declare in a declarative methodology, and the same with each part of the code

#### UPDATING/IMPROVING A MODULE

some sort pf the same a developing one just rename the things into a declarative methodology

#### TIPS

> use lower_snake_case for variable names, and for some constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
> for the files use camelCase
> place the variable or regex condition in its corresponding file
